## Instructions

1. Install the NuGet package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/elFinder.NetCore/

2. Look at the [demo project](https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.NetCore/tree/master/elFinder.NetCore.Web) for an example on how to integrate it into your own project.

As simple as that!

## Azure Storage Driver

The Azure storage driver has now been moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/fsmirne/elFinder.NetCore.AzureStorage). For any issues related to Azure, please log them there.

## Credits

**elFinder.NetCore** is based on my [fork](https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.Net) of [elFinder.Net](https://github.com/leniel/elFinder.Net) by Leniel Macaferi which itself was based on an [older version](https://github.com/EvgenNoskov/Elfinder.NET) by Yevhen Noskov, which as far as I can tell is the original.

Many thanks also to [Flavio Smirne](https://github.com/fsmirne) for the excellent contribution of an Azure Storage driver and the work done to allow such extensibility.
